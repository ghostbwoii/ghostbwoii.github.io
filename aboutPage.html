					<p id="1">Doom (officially cased DOOM and occasionally DooM by fans, based on the Doom logo's stylized lettering) is the first release of the
					Doom series, and one of the games that consolidated the first-person shooter genre. With a science fiction and horror style, it gives
					the players the role of marines who find themselves in the focal point of an invasion from Hell. The game introduced deathmatch and 
					cooperative play in the explicit sense, and helped further the practice of allowing and encouraging fan-made modifications of commercial
					video games. It was first released on December 10, 1993, when a shareware copy was uploaded to an FTP server at the University of 
					Wisconsin. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

				<h3 onclick="displayBlock2();" id="dev">DEVELOPMENT</h3>
					<p id="2">The development of Doom began in late 1992, with John Carmack writing the new game engine while the rest of id Software was finishing 
					Spear of Destiny (the prequel to Wolfenstein 3D). When the full design phase began in late 1992, the main thematic influences were the movies
					Aliens and Evil Dead II, and the Dungeons & Dragons campaign the developers had been playing, where the forces of hell invaded the material 
					world. The title of the game was chosen by John Carmack: <i>There is a scene in "The Color of Money" where Tom Cruse [sic] shows up at a pool 
					hall with a custom pool cue in a case. "What do you have in there?" asks someone. "Doom." replied Cruse with a cocky grin. That, and the 
					resulting carnage, was how I viewed us springing the game on the industry.</i>Id's programmers had to make use of several tricks for these 
					features to run smoothly on 1993-vintage personal computers. Most significantly, Doom levels are not truly three-dimensional: they are 
					internally represented on a two-dimensional plane, with height differences added separately (a similar trick is still used by many games 
					to create huge outdoor environments). Doom also has a low-detail mode to improve frame rates on slower PCs, such as those with an 80386 
					processor.

				<h3 onclick="displayBlock3();" id="sto">STORY</h3>
					<p id="3" >Doom has a simple plot; its background is given in the instruction manual, and the in-game story advances mainly through short 
					messages displayed between the game's episodes.The player takes the role of a marine (unnamed to further represent the person playing), 
					"one of Earth's toughest, hardened in combat and trained for action", who has been incarcerated on Mars after assaulting a senior officer
					when ordered to fire upon civilians. There, he works alongside the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), a multi-planetary conglomerate and
					military contractor performing secret experiments on interdimensional travel. Recently, the teleportation has shown signs of anomalies 
					and instability, but the research continues nonetheless.Suddenly, something goes wrong and creatures from hell swarm out of the
					teleportation gates on Deimos and Phobos. A defensive response from base security fails to halt the invasion, and the bases are quickly
					overrun by monsters; all personnel are killed or turned into zombies. A military detachment from Mars travels to Phobos to investigate 
					the incident. The player is tasked with securing the perimeter, as the assault team and their heavy weapons are brought inside.
					Radio contact soon ceases and the player realizes that he is the only survivor. Being unable to pilot the shuttle off of Phobos by 
					himself, the only way to escape is to go inside and fight through the complexes of the moon base.

				<h3 onclick="displayBlock4();" id="leg">LEGACY</h3>
					<p id="4">Doom is widely regarded as one of the most important titles in gaming history. In the wake of its immense popularity, dozens of new 
					first-person shooter titles appeared, which were more often referred to as "Doom clones" than "first-person shooters". Id Software went
					on to release a sequel, Doom II, followed by an expanded edition for retail stores (The Ultimate Doom), and additional levels by 
					experienced WAD designers from the fan community (Master Levels for Doom II and the standalone Final Doom). Doom itself was eventually 
					ported to several dozen other operating systems and consoles.
